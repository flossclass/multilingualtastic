use strict;

#1.) print something to the screen


#2.)    What you printed to the screen -- that was a string. Google "perl strings" for more information.
#       Store that string in a variable. The type of variable you'll use is the "scalar" variable starts with a dollar sign.
#       Google "perl variables" for more info. *Remember to put "my" before the variable*.


#3.)   Now, only print out the first two words of the string in this variable.
#      Do this by counting how many letters are in the first two words, and google "perl substring" to implement this.


#4.)   Print a string (using double quotes) that literally looks like this: "five\none"

#4.1)   Print a string (using single quotes) that literally looks like this: "five\none"
